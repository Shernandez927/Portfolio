# <Portofino>

## Description

- This project consists of a starter portfolio page that aims to showcase my acquired skills and highlight my best work to eventually show to potential employers in the future.

- This portfolio will utilize HTML, CSS, as well as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables to demonstrate what I have learned over the course of this bootcamp.

- This portfolio is currently a draft that will be continually updated in project content and look as I learn more and complete more projects.
